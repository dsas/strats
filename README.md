# Introduction
The "Activity Segment Ranker" allows you to view the friend leaderboard for all of the segments for an activity on one web page. This is quicker than going through each segment one-by-one and clicking to view the friend leaderboard.

# Installation
 1. Clone the repository
 2. Make the public directory web accessible
 3. Register strava api keys on https://www.strava.com/settings/api
 4. Set environment variables for STRAVA_CLIENT_ID and STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET using the values that Strava give you
 6. Run composer install


Or just [give it a try](https://strats.deansas.org/)

# Status
It does the above, it's not especially clean, it's not especially quick and it's not especially clever.
