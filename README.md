This project has been archived, [Strava have removed the leaderboard API endpoint](https://developers.strava.com/docs/segment-changes/) which this app depended upon.

# Introduction
The "Activity Segment Ranker" allows you to view the friend leaderboard for all of the segments for an activity on one web page. This is quicker than going through each segment one-by-one and clicking to view the friend leaderboard.

# Installation
 1. Clone the repository
 2. Make the web directory web accessible
 3. Copy config.php.dist to config.php
 4. Register strava api keys on https://www.strava.com/settings/api
 5. Fill in the blanks in config.php.dist using the strava details
 6. Run composer install


Or just [give it a try](https://strats.deansas.org/)
